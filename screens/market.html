			<p>It all begins here; At Evo Corp we're perpetually transforming to what today's market needs.</p>
			<p>Being a great organization requires a team with an endless transforming mindset. Innovation and how most traders make cargo purchase decisions tend to evolve by the minute. What worked yesterday may not necessarily work tomorrow in Star Citizen’s ever-changing economy.</p>
			<p>At Evo Corp we invest in tomorrow and we think one step ahead to prepare for the challenges of the future. In this driving economy we tilt the scale and hold the resources to give our partners an advantage and an edge over our constantly developing market.</p>
			<p>Ultimately, it comes down to asking yourself; Why choose us over other organizations? The answer is quite simple, we’re here to tell the truth and we get it done right. We care about the work that we do and to us, you’re not just another client. We're not running a 100-plus person department, so we can still be much more personal and hands-on with everyone that seeks our consultation. We are compliant with UEE law and ensure that everyone walks away with a smile.</p>
