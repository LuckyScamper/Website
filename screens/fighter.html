			<h2><span>F</span>ighter Wing</h2>
			<p>Fighter Wings are an extremely important asset to any self-respecting fleet: it provides not only cover against enemy vessels, but also provides a means of dealing damage to an enemies' fighter wings or fleets.</p>
			<p>Being nimble, fighters are also able to quickly enter atmospheres and provide cover to ground forces before the cavalry can arrive.</p>
			<p>These brave warriors are the reason Evo's assets - and that of its allies - are still standing.</p>
