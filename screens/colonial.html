			<p>It is not the bounty hunter, the pirate, the space mining group or the salvaging teams that are the bringers of the most profits, or the first and last bastions of defense.</p> 
			<p>It is the colonies.</p> 
			<p>"For me must consider we shall be as a city upon a hill, the eyes of all people shall be upon us..." - <i>John Winthrop,1630</i></p> 
			<p>Colonies are the first and last line of defense for any self-sufficient colony. It provides agricultural and mining enterprises for internal use or for sale to other orgs. All spacecraft of the EVO Corporation must be able to land there, repair, get medical attention, use its research facilities and load up on supplies. The crews of those ships must find R&R in the colony. So too must EVO's allies and partners be able to find safety and comfort in this colony and use its infrastructure and services for a reasonable cost.</p>
			<p>However, the colony is not without its risk. A colony can be quite easily destroyed by an overwhelming force or a Hercules, and the colonists must be able to recognize this and take all appropriate measures to defend the colony. They will stand, no matter the costs - as other move into the verse, they will remain on the ground so those in space have a place to return to.</p>
			<p>Therefore, the colony will be named "Lamark" after the Greek Mythos: a city where those hurt in space can find comfort, but also a place that is fragile.</p>
			<p>Are you up to the challenge of colony life? It will not be easy?</p>
