			<h2><span>E</span>xplorers</h2>
			<p>"What does it mean to be free? To blaze a path through the stars. To chart a course through the perilous void. To set food on worlds unexplored. To discover that which remains hidden from all. We are the light that shines through that dark night; the pathfinders who boldly go.</p> 
			<p>Welcome, Explorer."</p> 
			<p>- Head of Exploration</p> 
			<p>The Exploration Subdividion of falls under the jurisdiction of the <span>Research and Development</span> Division of Evo Corporation. From the small pathfinders to the largest of expeditionary vessels, Exploration takes on jobs both great and small. Simple surveying of mineral deposits and small derelicts is an option for those starting out. Even joint ventures with the military arms of Evo Corporation for recon duties.</p>
			<p>For those looking for more of a challenge, we engage in days long expeditions to distant star systems and worlds. You will spend days maybe even weeks away from Evo Corporation headquarters. These expedition teams will look for large derelicts, and may spend days on planets surveying for valuables to bring back to the research teams. Also, these teams search for potential new locations for Evo forward bases, or even a second headquarters.</p>
			<p>So, are you ready to be an Explorer?</p>
