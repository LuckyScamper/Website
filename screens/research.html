Research of new technologies, exploration and engineering fall under the purview of the division. Research and Development tend to work jointly with the other divisions. Serving as scouts in unexplored areas and scanning for new resources to exploit. </p>              
			<p>The R&D Division is headed by the Director of Science (O-7), who is assisted by the Deputy Director of Science (O-6).</p>
