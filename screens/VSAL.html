			<p>In Gemma, Elysium IV, on December 5, 2941, <i>Valkyrie Security and Logistics©</i> was officially chartered and founded. Originally run out of a garage in the fringe suburbs of Gemma and running personal security services in the area, it became a starfaring private military company on its anniversary four years later in December 5, 2945 with its bulk purchase of MISC Freelancers, Auroras, and Mustangs.</p>
			<p>Now, nearly four years later, <i>Valkyrie Security And Logistics©</i> has affiliated with the Evo Corporation to bring premium, affordable protection, transport, and administration across the galaxy. Utilizing Evo Corporation assets, Valkyrie Security And Logistics©’ range has been greatly increased allowing millions more citizens to request their services. </p>
			<p><i>Valkyrie Security and Logistics©</i> provides the manpower and machinery to ensure the smoothest and fastest transportation from one point to the next. With a lineup of Freelancers, Mustangs, Auroras, an Avenger, our most recently acquired Cutlass Black, a buy order for a retaliator, and plans in investing for a Hammerhead Corvette, we’re here to help ensure the safety of both you and your goods, whatever they may be.</p>
			<p>We can be contracted for a low fee primarily within the Elysium, Centauri, Kabal, and Idris systems for security, hauling, and administrative assistance by contacting our Contracting Executive, QuackerCracker. Special contract requests can also be made in the same way. We do not accept piracy contracts at this time.</p>
